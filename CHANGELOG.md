# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- **Toughest lines** now measures a fencer's **whole path to the title**, not just the bouts they fenced. For anyone knocked out early, the line is extended through the rounds they would have played had they kept winning, taking the actual occupant of each later slot as the opponent they would have met — so a first-round loser's draw is judged by the gauntlet they drew, not the single bout they got. Both reads span the full path: the headline figure, relabelled **Line avg** (was "Avg opp"), is the mean opponent rating along it, and **sweep odds** is now the chance of winning that whole path and taking the title. Champions and finalists are unchanged (they already fenced their whole line). `lineDifficulty` (`pipeline.js`) now takes the full field's DE bouts and traces the title path by chaining winners forward. Sweep odds prices the real bouts from the fencer's actual pre-bout ratings, then the would-be later rounds from the rating they carried into their last bout (an approximation — no within-event rating progression is simulated — flagged in code). Tests updated.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-06-04
### Added
- **Direct-elimination tableaus** on competition detail, now their own **Tableau** sub-tab (the page splits into Results / Tableau / Bouts). The bracket is reconstructed from the DE bouts by chaining winners forward — the FeNZ data carries round labels (`T64`/`QF`/`SF`/`Final`) and a winner but no seeds, so the topology is exact while the absolute line order is inferred. New tested helper `buildTableau` (`pipeline.js`) returns each match's column, row (its feeder pair's midpoint), feeder ids and the winner's pre-bout win probability; drawn by a new `DeTableau.jsx` as absolutely-positioned boxes over an SVG connector layer. Connector lines are coloured by how hard each win was (the same blue→red difficulty tiers as the Field overview); hovering any fencer fades the rest and traces their line. Builds cleanly on all 369 DE competitions in the dataset
- **Line difficulty**, surfaced as a **Toughest lines** table under the bracket: each DE entrant's run measured by average (and peak) opponent rating, plus **sweep odds** — the chance, from the ratings before each bout, of beating every opponent on their path (the product of their per-bout win probabilities, won or lost). Ranked by average opponent rating, top 3. New tested helper `lineDifficulty` (`pipeline.js`); shared `fmtSweepOdds` formatter floors near-impossible sweeps at `<0.1%`
- **Best and worst matchups** on the fencer profile — among opponents met at least three times, actual win rate versus what the model expected (mean pre-bout win probability). A positive gap is a best matchup, a negative one a worst (bogey) matchup, the kind of style problem a single rating can't see. New tested helper `matchups` (`pipeline.js`)
- **Rating ranges** on rating displays — `ratingInterval` / `fmtInterval` (`formatters.js`) reuse the existing `displayK` as the half-width, so the interval's lower bound is exactly the conservative rating already shown. Appears on the profile headline numbers and as a hover tooltip on the leaderboard
- **Method tab** with two panels: a predictive-accuracy dashboard and a plain-language **FAQ** (drafted, marked as a working draft). The dashboard backtests the win-probability model out of sample (every bout scored from the ratings as they stood *before* that competition) via new tested helper `predictiveAccuracy` (`pipeline.js`): favourite-win accuracy, Brier and log-loss against coin-flip baselines, and a calibration table + reliability plot, filterable by stream (pool/DE) and to established fencers only. New `AccuracyDashboard.jsx`, `Faq.jsx`, `Method.jsx`, plus a Method nav entry. Reproduces the documented ~67% accuracy and 0.18–0.20 Brier on the committed dataset (asserted by a test)
- **Experimental inactivity time-decay** — a fencer's rating deviation can grow with time out of competition (`phi' = sqrt(phi^2 + c^2 · years_idle)`, the standard Glicko-2 inactivity step, capped at the initial RD), so a long-idle rating widens and, conservatively displayed, drifts down until they next fence. New `inactivityDecayC` setting (default **0 = off**, tunable in `/#admin`) and `decayRD` (`glicko2.js`), applied as a pre-period snapshot step in `processBouts`. Behaviour-preserving when off (tested); the suggested ~0.2 starting value is unvalidated, with the new accuracy dashboard as the way to check it
### Notes
- The `bouts` records already carried pre-event ratings and RDs, so the accuracy backtest is genuinely out-of-sample at the event level rather than a curve fit
- Existing users should click *Defaults* in the Settings panel to pick up the new `inactivityDecayC`

## [0.1.14] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- Expected pool wins + a bout-difficulty "Field overview" on competition detail and fencer profiles. Each pool/DE bout is a **V/D box coloured by how hard the opponent was** — the pre-bout win probability bucketed blue (Easy, ≥80%) → green (Favoured) → grey (Even) → orange (Hard) → red (Very hard, <20%). Each fencer's **expected pool wins** (Σ win-probability), **actual**, and the **difference** are shown, so you can see who over- or under-performed their draw. New tested helpers `winProbability` (`glicko2.js`), `difficultyTier` and `fieldOverview` (`pipeline.js`); bout records now carry pre-event RD (`rdABefore`/`rdBBefore`) so difficulty is judged at the time of the event, not today
### Changed
- Head-to-Head's predicted outcome now uses the shared `winProbability` helper — same formula, single source of truth
### Notes
- The win-probability model is **calibrated** against the dataset: predicted favourites win at close to the predicted rate (67% accuracy overall, 73% for established fencers with rating history; Brier 0.18–0.20 and log-loss 0.54–0.59, both better than the 0.25 / 0.69 coin-flip baselines). The calibration bins track the diagonal — a predicted 70–80% favourite wins ~76–80%, a 90%+ favourite wins 97%. A pre-draw predictor (expected wins *before* an event runs) would need the pool sheet up front and remains a follow-on

## [0.1.13] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- "Results" view on the Competition detail Performance table, now the **default** ordering (toggle back to "Elo change" anytime). Official placings aren't in the FeNZ data, so placement is reconstructed from the DE bracket (new tested helper `deFinish` in `pipeline.js`) and shown as a place: `1` (won the DE), `2` (lost the final), then `3rd tied` (fencing awards two bronzes and runs no 3rd-place bout, so both losing semi-finalists are 3rd with no 4th), then the round's place band for the deeper rounds — `5–8` (lost a quarter), `9–16`, `17–32`, …; pool-only fencers get the below-the-cut range (DE entrants + 1 … field size). Each row shows its placement and W–L record. Addresses the FEEDBACK Round 3 request to "see who won, not just elo gain"
- A fencer's displayed club now follows their **most recent** bout instead of the first one seen, so fencers who change clubs show their current affiliation (FEEDBACK Round 3, Brendan Lindsay)
- Gender fallback for mixed-event-only fencers — fencers who only ever appeared in mixed events have no single-gender row to vote on, so `processBouts` left their gender unset and they vanished from both the Men's and Women's leaderboards (33 rated fencers, 11 with foil bouts). Gender now falls back to the FNZ registry ranking keys (`foil_W` / `epee_M`) when bout data is inconclusive, recovering 31 of them; the remaining 2 (unregistered, or holding both-gender rankings) stay out rather than be guessed. A tooltip on the Min Bouts control also points fencers who don't see themselves at the weapon/gender filters
### Fixed
- Activity-implausible dates of birth no longer win the registry lookup. When a fencer is split into two records by a data-entry typo on one DOB, `buildEnrichmentIndex` could surface the wrong year — Chantelle May appeared as 2018 (impossible: she holds a 2024 national foil ranking, so she'd be 6) instead of 2004, which had placed a senior fencer in the Junior and Cadet leaderboards. A DOB that would make the fencer younger than 8 at the time of any ranking they hold is now demoted. The guard is deliberately narrow — exactly one record in the registry trips it — so genuine namesakes are left alone (the two James McKenzies, a 1977 veteran and a 1997 senior, both stay plausible and unchanged)

## [0.1.12] - 2026-05-28
### Fixed
- Medical and other non-result withdrawals no longer move ratings. FeNZ tableau data carries a per-fencer result `code`; alongside the normal `V`/`D` (victory/defeat) it uses `MED` (medical), `A` (abandon), `DNF`, and `E`/`EXC` (exclusion) for fencers who didn't lose on the strip. The ingest now reads this code and tags such bouts with a new `flag` column (`wd_a` / `wd_b`); `processBouts` records the bout as a loss for the fencer who withdrew and a win for the opponent, but contributes nothing to either rating. The 16 such bouts already in `bouts.csv` — recorded as 0–0 results that nudged both ratings as ties — were backfilled from the API cache. Reported via an anonymous DM (FEEDBACK Round 3)
- Secondary Schools events were classified as Senior. They match no U-band keyword (`U15`, `cadet`, `junior`, …) so `parseAgeCategory` fell them through to `senior`, feeding their bouts into the Senior/Junior/Cadet streams and able to make a school-only fencer a "native Senior". They're now classified as Cadet — the conservative choice for an NZ school-age field (years 9–13), so the bouts never count upward. Investigation note: the Senior rating *stream* itself was never contaminated by younger results (downward inclusion only flows Senior→Junior→Cadet), so the broader "U17s rated high" perception in FEEDBACK Round 3 is mostly the default "All ages" view blending categories — a separate UX item
- Sibling DOB collisions in the licence registry. A shared or mis-entered licence number in the source Fencing Time XML can fold a stray name alias of one family member into another's record — e.g. Kate Gourley's record carried the alias `daniel gourley`. `buildEnrichmentIndex` resolved the `daniel gourley` key to whichever record had the most signal, and the club-count tiebreaker handed it to the sibling, surfacing the wrong DOB (Daniel Gourley showed 2005, his sister's year, instead of 2007 — which also wrongly dropped him from the Junior leaderboard; the 0.1.10 note recorded this as correct). The lookup now gives a record an ownership bonus for a `name_key` equal to its own `display_name`, so the person literally named "Daniel Gourley" wins that key over a sibling listing it as an alias. Corrects Gourley, plus Craig & Stacy Chong, Milo Henshaw, Luke Boyd, and Tim Wang
### Added
- A `node:test` suite (`frontend/test/`) with an `npm test` script — no new dependencies. Covers age-category classification (incl. the Secondary Schools case), withdrawal rating behaviour against both synthetic bouts and the committed dataset, and the registry DOB-collision fix with a guard that no canonically-named fencer loses their own name key to a sibling
- `flag` column in the ingest CSV schema (`fenz_ingest.py`) — empty for normal bouts; `wd_a` / `wd_b` / `wd` mark withdrawals. Older CSVs without the column parse unchanged

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-19
### Changed
- Competition Detail "Performance" table now orders fencers by total Elo change at that event (pool delta + DE delta), highest first, with an italic caption stating the ordering. Previously sorted by post-event rating, which mixed pool-only and DE-after values on different scales and could rank a high-rated early-exit above the gold medallist. Final placement isn't in the dataset, so Elo movement is the most informative proxy currently available
- Import (data ingest) and Tuning (rating parameters) moved off the public nav and into the Admin panel at `/#admin` as new section pills next to Edits and Clubs. Same token gate as the rest of admin. Public visitors now see only Ledger / Competitions / Clubs / Head-to-Head. `EmptyState`'s "Import Results" button redirects to `/#admin`
### Fixed
- `EditPanel` text inputs (display name, current club, merge target) no longer lose focus after each keystroke. The inner `Row` helper was defined inside the parent's render body, giving it a fresh component identity per render; React saw a new component type each time and remounted the `<input>`, dropping focus and the IME selection. Hoisted `Row` to module scope with `openId` / `setOpen` props so the input now has a stable parent and keeps focus while typing

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-19
### Added
- DOB-based eligibility for the Cadet and Junior leaderboards — when the fencer is in the XML registry, age category derives from `dob_year` directly. Junior cutoff is `currentYear - 20` (born 2006+ in the 2026 season), Cadet is `currentYear - 17` (born 2009+). Auto-rolls each year as `currentYear` shifts. Fencers without a DOB still pass through the old event-tag inference. Net effect on Mens Épée Junior: list grows 55 → 68; Daniel Gourley (2005) correctly drops out, Joel Ball-La Hood, Nolan Peterson, Jack Hansen, Elliot Hayes, Josh Carson and ~10 others correctly appear despite skipping the 2026 junior-tagged events
- Weapon-aware Clubs page — respects the global weapon pill. The Mens Épée view now ranks clubs by their Mens Épée DE median; clubs whose entire roster is in other weapons (NZ Academy of Fencing — 29 members, all foil/sabre) no longer top the list with 0 épéeists
- Admin club editor at `/#admin` → Clubs section — set per-club website, location, and FNZ-affiliation status (yes/no/unknown). Rendered under the club heading on `ClubDetail`. Lays the groundwork for the "where should I fence?" reframe in FEEDBACK Round 2
- Admin fencer-to-club reassignment in the same panel — pick any fencer from a dropdown, type the destination club, Apply. Writes to the existing `club_overrides` doc so public reads share one code path with fencer-driven self-edits
- New `/api/admin` actions: `set_club_meta`, `clear_club_meta`, `assign_fencer`. `/api/overrides` now returns a `club_meta` map alongside the existing name/club/flagged docs
- Plausibility filter in `fencerinfo_ingest.py` rejects DOBs that would make a fencer younger than 7 in the current year — caught 14 XML data-entry errors (Brendan Lindsay as "born 2026", Thibault Schneider, etc.) that would otherwise false-positive into Cadet
- Visual sort indicators (`↓` arrow + active-row bolding) on the Bouts and W·L Leaderboard headers — the sort math always worked but the active-state cue was missing
### Changed
- Strength-tier letter on the Clubs page now requires at least 3 members active in the selected weapon. Under-threshold clubs show an em-dash instead of A/B/C, so a 1-fencer outpost with a single star can't outrank a deep club via median games. Partially addresses FEEDBACK Round 2 item #1 (club strength tier favoured tiny clubs)
- Activity gate on DOB-based junior/cadet filtering was dropped: being age-eligible is enough. Previously a junior who hadn't entered the 2026 season was excluded; now Joel Ball-La Hood (last épée 2024) and Nolan Peterson (last épée 2025) correctly appear in the 2026 junior leaderboard. The no-DOB fallback path still enforces recent activity as a sanity gate
- `bouts.csv` extended through Ongley Memorial Tournament 2026 (May 10) and Mark Rance Memorial 2026 (May 9). Dataset grows 16,509 → 17,061 bouts; range now 2024-02-17 → 2026-05-10
- Override-doc edit key now matches the bout-derived fencer key — client sends its own `fencer_key` with edits and the server verifies it's an alias of the licenced fencer before honouring. Fixes a bug where overrides for Joel Ball-La Hood wrote under the alphabetically-first alias and were silently never read on the public site
- `/api/overrides` accepts a `?t=` cache-bust query param via `loadOverrides({ fresh: true })`; `EditPanel` and the dispute button now trigger a refresh after submit so the change is visible without a hard reload
- Redis env-var detection in `api/_lib.js` accepts both Vercel marketplace defaults (`KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`) and direct Upstash installs (`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`); `fencerInfo()` falls back to an HTTP self-fetch when the bundled file can't be read from disk (covers `includeFiles` path quirks)
- Default git author on commits to this repo is now "Nolan Peterson" rather than "Nolan"
### Removed
- Decorative dingbats — fleuron (`❦`) in the App footer and Header tagline, and the `✓` checkmark on the Import success banner. Functional arrows (sort `↓`, score-flow `→`) kept

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-19
### Added
- Fencer licence registry (`ingest/fencerinfo_ingest.py`) — walks `Fencerinfo/uploads/*.xml` (Fencing Time exports), aggregates per fencer (most-recent display name, DOB year, all clubs seen, current club, handedness, nation, latest FNZ ranking per weapon, all licence numbers) and emits `ingest/fencers.json` with SHA-256-peppered `licence_hashes` in place of raw licences; 1,355 unique fencers from 803 XML files, 940 with at least one licence hash (1,334 hashes total once year-on-year FNZ renewals and FIE numbers collapse into single records via `(loose-name, dob-year)` merging); SP-prefixed licences (the new FNZ format) and 4 data-entry oddballs (`FNZ #20499`, `20377'`) round-trip via shared `normalise_licence()` in both ingest and frontend
- DOB year / handedness / nation surfaced on `FencerProfile` (under the name heading) when the fencer is in the XML registry
- Licence-based sign-in — Header "Sign in" button opens `LoginModal`, hashes the entered licence client-side via `crypto.subtle` with `VITE_LICENCE_PEPPER`, looks up the matching fencer in the shipped `fencers.json`, persists the hash in `localStorage` for session restore; signed-in state shows the fencer's display name + Sign out, clicking the name jumps to their profile; "You" badge on own profile
- Live profile edits for signed-in fencers (`EditPanel`) — display name and current club apply immediately to the public site via `POST /api/edit` → Upstash override doc; merge-duplicate requests are queued for admin review
- Dispute bout flow — "Dispute" button per bout row on your own profile (signed-in only) opens a reason prompt, submits a dispute that immediately flags the bout fingerprint publicly (small `flagged` badge on the row) and enqueues an admin review item
- Admin queue at `/#admin` (hash-routed, off the visible nav) — paste the `ADMIN_TOKEN` once, see all submissions filterable by `pending` / `applied` / `all`, approve / reject pending items, revert applied items (clears the override and the bout-derived value reappears)
- Vercel Functions backing the edit flow (`frontend/api/`) — `POST /api/edit` (verifies licence hash against bundled `fencers.json`, rate-limits 20/h per hash via `@upstash/ratelimit`, writes to Upstash), `GET /api/overrides` (public, edge-cached 30 s, returns applied name/club overrides + flagged-bout set), `GET/POST /api/admin` (bearer-token gated)
- `frontend/vercel.json` bundles `public/data/fencers.json` into the function image so licence verification works at runtime without an extra HTTP hop
- Visual sort indicators (`↓` arrow + cell bolding) on the Bouts and W·L Leaderboard columns, matching the existing Pool and DE feedback — the underlying sort math already worked but had no clear active-state cue
- `SETUP.md` — Upstash provisioning steps, env var details, edit-kind matrix
### Changed
- `frontend/scripts/copy-data.mjs` now also copies `ingest/fencers.json` into `public/data/` at build time, so the licence registry ships with every Vercel deploy
- `App.jsx` layers Upstash overrides over the bout-derived `fencers` map after `processBouts` runs (name + club overrides) and threads a `flagged_bouts` Set into `FencerProfile` — rating math is unaffected by edits in this release
- Redis env-var detection in `api/_lib.js` accepts both Vercel marketplace defaults (`KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`) and direct Upstash installs (`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`), so no renaming is needed after the marketplace integration
### Removed
- Fleuron ornament (`❦`) from the App footer and Header tagline, and the `✓` check from the Import success message — purely decorative dingbats that didn't earn their pixels
### Security / privacy
- `Fencerinfo/` (raw XML with full DOBs and licence numbers) added to `.gitignore` — only the derived `fencers.json` (DOB year only, hashed licences) ships to GitHub or Vercel
- `VITE_LICENCE_PEPPER` lives in `.env` / `frontend/.env` (both gitignored); Vite bundles it into the client at build time so login can hash a user-entered licence with the same salt the ingest used. Treat the pepper as obfuscation rather than secrecy — it raises the bar from "trivially rainbow-tabled" to "requires inspecting the JS bundle", which is the right tradeoff for a public site without a backend

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed
- Mixed events no longer double-count Elo — when the scraper ingested the same physical event twice (once as "X - Mens" and once as "X - Womens", e.g. Russell Towns Open 2024, mid-year regionals), every bout was being processed twice and gains/losses were doubled; `processBouts` now detects these via `detectMixedEvents` (shared bout hashes between the two variants), rewrites both copies to a single canonical name, and drops duplicate rows by `boutHash` before any rating math runs (44 mixed events detected in the current dataset, ~1300 duplicate rows removed)
- Women appearing in the men's leaderboard (e.g. Mei Admiraal, Madelaine Barbarics) — gender was previously locked to the first row seen, and the "- Mens" duplicate of a mixed event sorted before "- Womens" so women got stuck on M; replaced with a majority-vote tally across single-gender event rows only (mixed-event rows have their gender label cleared so they don't contribute noise), finalized after all bouts are processed
- Mixed-event competitions are now reconstructed under both Mens and Womens filters on the Competitions page (post-dedupe their row-level gender labels were blank; the pipeline now repopulates `comp.genders` from participants' finalized genders)
### Added
- Per-age-category rating streams under `fencer.byWeapon[w].byAge.{cadet,junior,senior,veteran}` — Cadet/U13–U17/Junior/U20/Veteran are parsed from competition names via `parseAgeCategory` (with an `AGE_OVERRIDES` map for manual corrections); the top-level `pool`/`de` rating still reflects every bout
- Downward-inclusive Elo flow — a bout in category X feeds the streams for X and every younger category in the Cadet→Junior→Senior chain (Senior feeds Senior+Junior+Cadet, Junior feeds Junior+Cadet, Cadet feeds itself); Veteran is isolated so vet bouts don't contaminate the open chain and vice versa
- Age-category dropdown in the header next to weapon/gender pills, switching the Leaderboard rating column and bout counts to the selected category's stream; the leaderboard heading reflects the active category
- Leaderboard membership for an age category requires **native** participation — you only appear in the Junior leaderboard if you've fenced a Junior-tagged event, not just because Senior bouts fed your Junior rating via downward inclusion (tracked in `fencer.nativeCategories[weapon]`); cadets are also juniors by age, so cadet-event participation also qualifies a fencer for the Junior leaderboard (rating math is unaffected — cadet bouts still don't feed the Junior stream)
- Recency filter for age leaderboards — to appear under Cadet/Junior/Veteran you must have a native bout in that category in the dataset's most recent year (auto-computed from the latest bout date, currently 2026), keeping aged-out fencers out of the Junior rankings
- `ageCategory` field on each bout record and competition for downstream filtering and display
- `FEEDBACK.md` — running log of user-reported feedback with status (open/addressed/deferred), source, quote, root cause, and resolution; seeded with the post-launch feedback that drove this release
### Removed
- "Senior" option from the age-category dropdown — "All ages" already serves as the open/senior view, and the senior-only stream produced confusing numbers (different from "All ages" because opponent ratings diverge across streams); the underlying `byAge.senior` stream is retained because it still feeds Junior and Cadet via downward inclusion

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- Canonical dataset published with the deployment — `frontend/scripts/copy-data.mjs` copies `ingest/*.csv` into `frontend/public/data/` (and writes a `manifest.json`) before every `npm run dev` / `npm run build`; on first load the app fetches the manifest and uses those CSVs as the dataset, so visitors always see the latest pushed data instead of an empty `localStorage`
- `parseCSV` is now exported from `data/pipeline.js` so the load path can reuse it
### Changed
- When the canonical dataset is served, `rawBouts` is no longer persisted to `localStorage` (only `settings` is) — Import-tab additions become session-only on the deployed site, ensuring everyone sees the same canonical data
- Adding new bouts now follows: run the ingest script → commit `ingest/*.csv` → push; Vercel rebuilds and the new dataset is live

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-10
### Added
- Clubs ledger (new top-level tab) — clubs ranked by DE median across all weapons with the active gender filter; sortable by Members or DE top; clubs with fewer than 5 fencers are demoted to the bottom of DE rankings and tagged "under 5 fencers"
- Club detail page — member count, M/W split, by-weapon DE/pool breakdowns, by-gender × weapon breakdowns, and a member list sorted by best conservative DE rating
- Club-name canonicalization in `data/pipeline.js` (`CLUB_ALIASES` map + `canonicalizeClub` helper) — merges ~25 spelling variants (e.g. "Auckland Swords" / "Auckland Swords Club", "Mt Albert Grammar School" / "Mount Albert Grammar School", "VUW" / "Victoria University of Wellington Swords Club") so each club appears once across the Clubs ledger, Leaderboard club filter, and FencerProfile
- Click-through from club names — Leaderboard rows, FencerProfile header, and CompetitionDetail performance rows now navigate to the club detail page when a club name is clicked
### Changed
- Detail-page Back buttons restore the originating view via a navigation stack — clicking a club from the Leaderboard returns to the Leaderboard, clicking a fencer from a competition returns to that competition, etc.; top-tab clicks clear the stack so tabs remain fresh starts

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-09
### Fixed
- Competitions tab column headers (Date, Field size, Strength) are now part of an aligned column-header row instead of a floating widget — "Field size" no longer reads as the label for the tier letter column
- Competition list now sorts chronologically when CSVs use `D/M/YYYY` or `M/D/YYYY` instead of ISO — `processBouts` detects the date format from the dataset and normalizes all dates to `YYYY-MM-DD` before sorting or formatting
- Same-day competitions now have a deterministic order (name tiebreaker) instead of reshuffling on each render
- Added column gap between the Top and Strength headers so they no longer visually run together
### Changed
- Leaderboard default sort changed from Pool rating to DE rating
- Competition sort headers are now reversible — click an active header to flip direction (newest↔oldest, strongest↔weakest, largest↔smallest); arrow indicator updates accordingly

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-09
### Added
- `Conservative display k` setting (default 1) — controls how much rating uncertainty is subtracted from the displayed number
- `conservativeRating` / `fmtConservativeRating` helpers in `utils/formatters.js`
### Changed
- Default initial RD lowered from 350 to 200 — fits an established league where most imported fencers already have years of history; new fencers settle into their true rating faster, at the cost of slightly less headroom for veterans on first import
- Displayed rating is now `rating − k × RD` (TrueSkill-style conservative rating) across the Leaderboard, fencer profile headline numbers, weapon pills, rating-progression chart, and the head-to-head fencer picker — a fencer with `1800 ± 300` shows as 1500 and climbs toward 1800 as their RD shrinks
- Leaderboard pool and DE sorts now order by conservative rating, so a steady 1500 outranks an uncertain 1800
- Peak rating on fencer profiles is now computed as the highest conservative rating over history; raw rating and RD still appear as a secondary line so the underlying Glicko-2 number stays inspectable
### Notes
- Per-bout before/after deltas (FencerProfile bout rows, CompetitionDetail) and competition median/top remain raw — those snapshots don't carry an RD alongside the rating
- Existing users' saved settings persist; click *Defaults* in the Settings panel to pick up the new `initialRD` and `displayK`

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- Fencers now infer gender from competition name when the gender CSV field is blank, using the same keyword logic as the ingest script ("women" checked before "men")
- Each fencer is locked to the first gender determined — subsequent bouts cannot reassign them to a different category, preventing name-collision cross-contamination

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- Fencers with no recorded gender no longer appear in both Men's and Women's categories — gender filter now requires an explicit match in Leaderboard, Competitions, and FencerPicker

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-30
### Added
- Leaderboard with separate pool and DE ratings per fencer per weapon
- Fencer profiles with rating progression chart
- Competition browser with field strength tiers (A–D based on pool median)
- Head-to-head comparison with predicted win probabilities per stream
- CSV import from FENZ Database (file upload or paste) and fictional demo dataset
- Configurable rating parameters (initial rating/RD/volatility, tau, upset threshold and multiplier)
- Python ingest script (`ingest/fenz_ingest.py`) for pulling bout data from the FeNZ public API

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-29

Initial release.
- Built the prototype of the app using ClaudeCode
-  Made minor design decisions such as elo system and styling.
- Ran into issues pulling the CSV results from Fencingtimelive so looking for a workaround.
